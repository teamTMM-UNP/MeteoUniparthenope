# Sinopia

`npm set registry http://nsbuildlin01.bedford.progress.com:4873`

## Installation

0. Install nvm. Use node 4+.
1. `npm install`
2. `./install.sh` (requires sudo privileges) will copy the service file to the correct systemd store
3. `systemctl start sinopia-cache.service`

## Monitoring and troubleshooting

1. The service starter script is `sinopia-cache.sh`. It requires nvm set up for the `nsbuilduser` user.
2. Package cache goes in the `./storage` dir.
3. The service file contains absolute paths to the install location. You might want to change that for your setup.
4. Check `sinopia.log` and `/var/log/syslog`

## Running locally

Might be useful for tests. Just do a `npm start`

## Changing Sinopia options

`config.yaml` is the right place.
